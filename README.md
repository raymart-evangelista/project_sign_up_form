In this project, I learned more about html, css, and javascript. This project put to the test how well I absorbed the lessons on forms and the intermediate css concepts. The most challenging aspect was determining how to make the webpage responsive at different aspect ratios. For most desktop aspect ratios, the website works. When the aspect ratio gets smaller, the website isn't displayed properly, and this is something The Odin Project said not to worry about as of right now. Another challenge was positioning especially with the image and the text overlaying it.

My workflow was all over the place to begin with. Even though I thought I had a good starting place, my code got really messy continuing on. I ended up getting lost in my spaghetti code and decided to create attempts at styling the text input boxes and button in their own "mini projects" so I don't get overwhelmed by the rest of the unfinished website. I then did a similar method to the password validation. 

For future projects, I will do my best to make my workflow similar to this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bn-DQCifeQQ&list=WL&index=2, where I create the basic html version first, then style the css. By also putting styling attempts in their own contained projects, that helped remove working on unnecessary parts of the program. 

Overall, this project was challenging and exciting to do.
