- box shadows: https://getcssscan.com/css-box-shadow-examples

In this project, I learned more about html, css, and javascript. This project put to the test how well I absorbed the lessons on forms and the intermediate css concepts. The most challenging aspect was determining how to make the webpage responsive at different aspect ratios. For most desktop aspect ratios, the website works. When the aspect ratio gets smaller, the website isn't displayed properly, and this is something The Odin Project said not to worry about as of right now. Another challenge was positioning especially with the image and the text overlaying it.

Overall, this project was challenging and exciting to do.
